# Calorie & Weight Trend Model

This is an interactive model designed to simulate and predict future weight trends. It calculates an estimated daily calorie expenditure and projects weight changes based on user inputs, including Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), daily caloric intake, and activity levels.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **BMR Calculation:** Input for customized metabolic rate.
    
- **Calorie Trend Simulation:** Projects weight loss or gain over time.
    
- **Simple Interface:** Focus on clear data input and output.
    

## 🤖 Entirely Generated by Gemini

**This entire codebase, including all foundational logic, user interface components, and file structure, was conceived and generated solely by the Gemini large language model.**

It serves as a demonstration of advanced AI-assisted development and collaborative prompt engineering capabilities.

## 💻 How to Run

To use the model, simply open the main file (e.g., `index.html` or `app.js`) in a modern web browser or execution environment.
